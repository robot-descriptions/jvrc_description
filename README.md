## History

This model comes from [mc\_rtc\_data](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/mc_rtc_data), a collection of robot and environment models distributed with the [mc\_rtc](https://jrl-umi3218.github.io/mc_rtc/) framework. It was initially created for the JVRC competition in VRML format at [jvrc/model](https://github.com/jvrc/model), and converted to URDF using [simtrans](https://github.com/fkanehiro/simtrans).
